 * @brief This example is for you to practice arithmetic operators.
 * @details This program performs a few operations on a variable that you need
 * to declare. In addition, you have to write operations yourself, some of which
 * are already provided but you need to rewrite using combined operators.
 * To see the compilation and execution commands, refer to the first exercise.
 * You are strongly encouraged to type them yourself, rather than copy/pasting,
 * as it may help you memorise.
