 * @brief This example is for you to practice variable declarations.
 * @details This program prints the value of two variables. However, these two
 * variables are not declared. The objective is for you to declare the two
 * variables and initialise them to the value indicated.
 * To see the compilation and execution commands, refer to the first exercise.
 * You are strongly encouraged to type them yourself, rather than copy/pasting,
 * as it may help you memorise.
