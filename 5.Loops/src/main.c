 * @details This program contains a loop to built, using both 'while' and 'for'
 * versions.
 * If you end up in a situation where your loop executes indefinitely, issue
 * CTRL + C.
 * (Note: even for Mac users, press CTRL + C, not CMD + C).
 * To see the compilation and execution commands, refer to the first exercise.
 * You are strongly encouraged to type them yourself, rather than copy/pasting,
 * as it may help you memorise.
