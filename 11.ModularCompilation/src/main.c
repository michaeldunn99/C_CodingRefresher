/**
 * @file main.c
 * @author Ludovic Capelli (l.capelli@epcc.ed.ac.uk)
 * @brief This example is for you to practice modular compilation.
 * @details This exercise makes you create two distinct pairs of header / source
 * files, by moving one function from this file main.c to each. The objective is
 * for you to then compile each source file independently to its own object
 * file, before linking all three object files to a single executable.
 * To see the compilation and execution commands, refer to the first exercise.
 * You are strongly encouraged to type them yourself, rather than copy/pasting,
 * as it may help you memorise.
