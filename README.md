 ## C Coding Refresher Exercises

Note: 
- Work in progress
- Each exercise is attempted and runs.
- However, Pagerank application is WIP - it currently runs if all code included as a singular main.c file. However, tried to refactor out the "helper functions" into helper_functions.c and compile this separately but experiencing a segmentation fault.
- Language for commit messages is inconsistent but generally "Complete Ex. X" / "Ex. X Complete" / "Completing Ex. X" indicates that Exercise X has been completed.
